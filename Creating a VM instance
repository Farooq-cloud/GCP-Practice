Creating a Compute Engine (VM instances):

* Go to compute Engine.
* Then click on Create instance.
* In name give your preferred name for VM.(Name should only be in Small letter)
* Give some labels
* Select the region and Zone. Which i have selected Asia-south1(Mumbai) Zone asia-south1-a
* Select General purpose CPU i.e E2 medium.
* In Boot disk option -> select operating system. I have selected Debian GNU/Linux 10(buster) with 10 GB balanced persistent disk.
* In Service accounts -> Select Compute Engine default service account.
* In Access scopes -> Allow default access.
* In Firewall -> Select Allow HTTP traffic.
* At the bottom we will find create option. Then select it and Vm instance will be created.
* Select SSH a new pop-up window will be appear. It will ask for authorization select it and terimal will open.
* Here are some of the commands we would execute in the next few steps:
* Installing HTTP Webserver on Google Compute Engine Virtual Machine.
* You can refer back to this if you have problems. Good Luck.

1.	sudo su
2.	apt update
3.	apt install apache2
4.	ls /var/www/html
5.	echo "Hello World!"
6.	echo "Hello World!" > /var/www/html/index.html
7.	echo $(hostname)
8.	echo $(hostname -i)
9.	echo "Hello World from $(hostname)"
10.	echo "Hello World from $(hostname) $(hostname -i)"
11.	echo "Hello world from $(hostname) $(hostname -i)" > /var/www/html/index.html
12.	sudo service apache2 start

Note: When you stop the instance old external Ip will be gone.And new ip will be assigned.

Remember:  Sometimes Google Cloud reuses the same external Ip on restart! Do not worry about it!
Creating static External ip address

* Go to VPC network option. Then select Ip address.
* There you will find your internal and external ip address.
* For creating static external ip. Select Reserve external static IP address.
* In name give my-first-external-static-ip-address.
* In network service tier. Select Premium(default).
* Ip Version I have selected IPV4
* In type select Regional (my VM region)
* In attached to Select my-first-vm.
* Static IP can be switched to another VM instance in same project.
* Static IP remains attached even if you stop the instance. You have to manually detach it. 
* Remember : You are billed for an Static IP when you are NOT using it! Make sure that you explicitly release an Static IP when you are not using it.
* We have deleted instance for checking.

Simplifying Web Server setup with Compute Engine Startup Script V2
* Installing OS patches or software when an VM instance is launched is called Bootstrapping.
* In VM you can configure startup script to bootstrap.

(Procedure)
* Now again creating the new instance with same about configurations.
* In Advance Options > Select Management.
*There we will have Automation. Below we have dailouge box to write the script.

* Startup script
# !/bin/bash 
# apt update 
# apt -y install apache2 
# echo "Hello world from $(hostname) $(hostname -I)" > /var/www/html/index.html
==============================================

Simplifying VM creation with Instance Templates

* Why do you need to specify all the VM instance details (Image, instance type etc) every time you launch an instance? 
* How about creating a Instance template? 
* Define machine type, image, labels, startup script and other properties. 
* Used to create VM instances and managed instance groups.
* Provides a convenient way to create similar instances CANNOT be updated.
* To make a change, copy an existing template and modify it .
* (Optional) Image family can be specified (example - debian-9): 
* Latest non-deprecated version of the family is used.
* DEMO - Launch VM instances using Instance templates.

(Procedure)
* Now copy the startup script from previous instance.
* Now select the instance template.
* Give name as my-instance-template-with-startup-script.
* Leave the same configurations as created for our VM.
* In Advance Options > Select Management.
* There we will have Automation. Below we have dailouge box to write the script.
* Startup script
# !/bin/bash 
# apt update 
# apt -y install apache2 
•	echo "Hello world from $(hostname) $(hostname -I)" > /var/www/html/index.html
=========================================

Reducing Launch Time with a Custom Image

* Installing OS patches and software at launch of VM instances increases boot up time.
* How about creating a custom image with OS patches and software pre-installed?
 * Can be created from an instance, a persistent disk, a snapshot, another image, or a file in Cloud Storage.
 * Can be shared across projects.
 * (Recommendation) Deprecate old images (& specify replacement image).
 * (Recommendation) Hardening an Image - Customize images to your corporate security standards.
 * Prefer using Custom Image to Startup script.
DEMO : Create a Custom Image and using it in an Instance Template.

(Procedure)
 
•	Creating a image.
•	Go to VM instance option there you will find out option called storage select that.

•	In Storage select Disk. Select the disk of VM instance from which you want to create Image.

•	In Actions Tab. We will find three dots select there we will find option create image.

* Then select create Image. 

Note: We should create a image of a Instance should be in stopped state.
Note: In Regions if you want image should in multi region select multi region option. If you want specifi region. Then select Regional

•	Now image will be created. If you want to check the private image. Select Image option there you will find out.

•	Then go to instance template. And select the instance template you want to copy and select copy option.


•	You will get new create template tab with previous configuration.

•	Give name as my-instance-template-with-custom-image. 

•	In boot disk select the customized image which we have created.

•	And select create. With these instance template we can launch as many instances we want.

* Now select instance template. And create a Virtual Machine.
===============================================

Troubleshooting Launch of Apache on GCP Virtual Machine

* In these steps lets try and understand debug problems. If you have problem installing apache web server (or) running the specific url.
* Make sure that you are using External Ip of the running instance.
* Go SSH in to It. And go to path /var/www/html/index.html and cat in to that path and check it.
* Now check the running status of apache2.
* Then also facing issue. Select the instance they you will find option called Firewall.
* In Firewall HTTP should be on.


===================================================

There are four types of CPU
* General purpose
* Compute Optimized(New)
* Memory Optimized
* GPUs
1.General Purpose (E2, N2, N2D, N1) : Best price-performance   ratio.
* Web and application servers, Small-medium databases, Dev environments.

2.Memory Optimized (M2, M1):  Ultra high memory workloads.
 * Large in-memory databases and In-memory analytics.

3.Compute Optimized (C2):  Compute intensive workloads 
* Gaming applications
